# Image-Based Expression Evaluation

## Project Overview
This project calculates the value of a mathematical expression based on an image that is drawn. Users can draw an expression, and the program processes the image to evaluate the mathematical result. The system is built using image processing techniques and mathematical expression parsing.

## Features
- **Image Input**: Draw or upload images containing mathematical expressions.
- **Image Processing**: Use image processing techniques to recognize and interpret the mathematical symbols and numbers in the image.
- **Expression Evaluation**: Evaluate the interpreted expression and return the calculated value.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for the project.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing tasks such as recognition and extraction of symbols.
- **NumPy**: For handling mathematical operations and arrays.
- **SymPy**: For parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Install the required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install opencv-python numpy sympy
